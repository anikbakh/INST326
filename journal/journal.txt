Week 1:
This week I used AI when brainstorming for ideas for an essay. I 
brainstormed for my Iranian cinema class what topics relevant to modern 
cinema I can write about. 
Additionally, I used Ai to help me with some doing techniques that I was not 
familiar with. Such as the max() function. I asked it to explan what this 
function is and what it is mostly used for. I then used the information it 
gave me to apply to the exercises assignment. I try my best not to use Ai for 
enviornmental and academic reasons. Only when I feel Ai would benefit me most 
do I utilize it.

Week 2:
This week I asked AI to explain the not function to me. I asked it to provide
it in simple terms and then provide me with examples of how it can be used. 
I also experimented with AI for marketing and creative materials. I provided it
with a screenshot of a poster I was making and asked what changes I could make 
to make it better. I used ChatGpt but didn't really enjoy the result it gave me.
It did not provide me with visual feedback but rather text-based feedback. I am
still searching for a better AI tool for creative work.

Week 3:
This week I used AI to help me with my BSCI135 class. I had a pre-lab reading
and quiz to do and as I have not studied biology much I wanted to make sure 
that I was understanding the material. I asked AI to explplain to me things 
such as gametes and zygotes. I also used it to teach me some Python functions 
that I did not know for the week 3 Exercises such as the purpose of triple 
quotation marks and args and kwargs from the lecture.

Week 4:
This week I used AI to help me with my statistics course. I utilized it to check my work when calculating z-score and checking for bugs in my code for R.
