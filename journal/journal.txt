This week I used AI when brainstorming for ideas for an essay. I 
brainstormed for my Iranian cinema class what topics relevant to modern 
cinema I can write about. 
Additionally, I used Ai to help me with some doing techniques that I was not 
familiar with. Such as the max() function. I asked it to explan what this 
function is and what it is mostly used for. I then used the information it 
gave me to apply to the exercises assignment. I try my best not to use Ai for 
enviornmental and academic reasons. Only when I feel Ai would benefit me most 
do I utilize it.
